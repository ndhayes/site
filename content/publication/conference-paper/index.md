abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) have been viewed traditionally as an acute individual illness. However, professionals are beginning to shift SUD treatment practices to match empirically driven models that consider family recovery as an important mechanism of systemic change. This study aimed to explore the relationship between family member hope and readiness to change (RTC). The method includes a dyadic actor-partner interdependence model, exploring change processes observed over a brief family treatment program located within an SUD treatment facility. Results of this study highlight actor effects for parentsâ€™ RTC and hope. Implications for research and clinicians are discussed.
